This repository contains a SMPTE 2042-1 VC-2 reference encoder and
decoder. It can be compiled using autotools on Linux or Windows and
includes the following executables once compiled:

 o EncodeStream -- an encoder which will encode a VC-2 compliant stream
   using one of the supported LD or HQ profiles.
 o DecodeStream -- a decoder which will decode a VC-2 compliant stream
   which complies with the LD or HQ profiles.

The EncodeStream tool supports the following profiles:
 o HQ_CBR -- an encoder for the High Quality (HQ) profile of
   VC-2 which encodes at a constant bit rate.
 o HQ_ConstQ -- an encoder for the High Quality (HQ) profile of
   VC-2 which encodes with a constant quantiser value.
 o LD -- an OBSOLETE encoder for the Low Delay (LD) profile of VC-2.
   (included for backwards compatibility).

In addition code is included for decoders (DecodeHQ and DecodeLD) which
take in the compressed bytes of a VC-2 frame without any surrounding
headers. These are not compiled by default but can be enabled with the
--enable-other-decoders flag to configure.

The googletest testing framework can be used to run tests on the
repository. This requires the googletest submodule to be added by
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
(or using --recurse-submodules when cloning)
Then using `make check' to build and run the tests.

Additional help on each executable will be printed if it is run with
the --help parameter.
